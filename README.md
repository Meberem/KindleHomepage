#Kindle Homepage

A super simple homepage that was supposed to be accessible on a kindle showing relevant info for my home built using TypeScript, React & Netlify.

Shows:

- The departing train times from nearest station using https://transport.rest
- Local weather using https://darksky.net

Needs:

- Better error handling
- Polyfills for Kindle experimental browser
- HTTP proxy or something as Kindle 4th gen will not connect to HTTPS
